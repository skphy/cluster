# cluster
- Cluster a set of molecules using the butina clustering : J. Chem. Inf. Comput. Sci. 1999, 39, 4, 747â€“750
- AND OTHERS SEE BELOW
- Cluster the conformers of a molecule based on the RMS threshold in angstrom.
- Pick molecules based on their fingerprint
- if two molecules are same by comparing the InChiKey representation?
- Reorder the atoms in a mol if their iare different smiles
- sanitize mol object and removes hydrogens from a molecule
- Find the pairwise tanimoto distance between the fingerprints of all the molecules
- conformers of a molecule
- Solvent Accessible Surface Area SASA
- coordinate of a conformer of a mole obj 
- centroid calculations ....
- some done .. and SOME TO DO .... SKUMAR
